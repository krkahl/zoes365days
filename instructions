###Dashboard
* Upon login, you will see the WordPress dashboard.
	* To access site features, use the sidebar located to the left.
	* Most settings will be unimportant for your use -- let me know if you need help!

* __Posts__
	* From the __Posts__ section you can easily add new post content that will automatically propagate to your blog homepage.

* __Media__
	* This section will allow you to manage any photos or videos on your account. It will also hold any photos that you've uploaded to posts.

* __Pages__
	* Any separate pages you have on your site will be in this section. *(Contacts, etc.)*

* __Portfolio__
	* You can upload anything you'd like to feature as part of your profile here -- it's not complete so I will assist with the changes necessary to feature the portfolio posts on your website.

###Plugins
* __Instagram__
	* The Instagram plugin connects your Instagram profile to the WordPress site. It is preconfigured -- if you have any changes you'd like to make I can help with that.
